# Front-End-Hotel
This is just a front-end project made while exploring Web Development.
I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and javascript. 
The project shows the main page of the "HOTEL REDSTONE", through navbar you can visit ABOUT US page and BOOKING page.
If you scroll down the main page there are three buttons which can take you to Special Offers, Gallery and Booking pages.
